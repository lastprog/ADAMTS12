Scripts used in "ADAMTS12 promotes fibrosis by restructuring ECM to enable activation and migration of injury-responsive fibroblasts"

Fibrosis represents the uncontrolled replacement of parenchymal tissue with extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by myofibroblasts. While genetic fate-tracing and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have helped elucidate fibroblast heterogeneity and ontogeny beyond fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, newly identified fibroblast populations remain ill-defined, both with respect to the molecular cues driving their differentiation, and their subsequent role in fibrosis. Using an unbiased approach, we identify the metalloprotease ADAMTS12 as a fibroblast-specific gene that is strongly upregulated during fibrogenesis in humans and mice. Functional in vivo knockout studies in mice confirmed that Adamts12 is critical during fibrogenesis in both heart and kidney. Mechanistically, by employing a combination of spatial transcriptomics and expression of catalytically active or inactive ADAMTS12, we demonstrate that the active  protease of ADAMTS12 shapes ECM composition to enable expansion and migration of a distinct injury-responsive fibroblast subset defined by Mt1 gene expression and strong JAK-STAT signaling.
